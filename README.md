# BYO Backing Track
## Created By Henry Rennell

# The Idea

My idea came from scouring the internet for backing tracks to improvise over, being a natural control freak, I wasn't satisfied with the results, excellent musically (most), however I wanted to use my own chords, my own progressions and my own BPM. Thus BYO Backing Track was born

By creating what is essentially a looper, I hope to be able to create a tool for musicians to quickly make simple backing tracks within the browser for their practise/improvisation or even for writing instrument parts or vocal melodies over.
